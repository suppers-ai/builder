## Notes

### Key Design Principles
- Keep controls simple and intuitive
- Gradual difficulty progression
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Maintain spooky-fun atmosphere (not scary)
- Ensure accessibility (colorblind modes, etc.)

### Technical Considerations
- Target 1920x1080 resolution with scaling
- Support both mouse and touch input
- Ensure game works offline after initial load
- Keep total size under 50MB for web delivery

### Development Timeline Estimate
- Week 1-2: Core mechanics & movement
- Week 3-4: Level design & obstacles
- Week 5-6: Polish, audio, and visual effects
- Week 7-8: Testing, bug fixes, and deployment

---

Start with the core mechanics first, then gradually add features. The game should be playable with just movement and basic obstacles before adding complex features.
