# Pricing System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of an intuitive pricing system where:
- **Admins** configure pricing products, variables, and formulas in the admin package
- **Users** simply select pre-configured variables (e.g., "Base Price") in the payments UI
- **Default data** is seeded in the database for common pricing scenarios

## Architecture Summary

### Admin Flow (Admin Package)
Admins configure the pricing infrastructure:
1. Create pricing products (templates like "Restaurant Booking", "Hotel Room", "Event Ticket")
2. Define variables with user-friendly names and validation
3. Create pricing formulas that use these variables
4. Set up default configurations for common business types

### User Flow (Payments Package)
Users get a simplified experience:
1. Create a regular product
2. Select from pre-configured pricing templates
3. Set values for pre-defined variables (e.g., set "Base Price" to $50)
4. Variables UI is hidden - they only see friendly input fields
