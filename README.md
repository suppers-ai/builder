# Initial Solobase Development

This was the initial workings of Solobase. There were so many changes/refactoring/restructuring that it was moved into a new clean repo at https://github.com/suppers-ai/solobase

## Project Statistics

### Codebase Size
- **Total Files**: 2,434 files (2,282 code files)
- **Lines of Code**: ~354,698 total
  - TypeScript/TSX: 198,337 lines
  - JavaScript/JSX: 136,599 lines
  - SQL: 4,416 lines
  - CSS: 15,346 lines

### Development with Kiro IDE

This substantial codebase was shaped and refined using Kiro IDE's advanced development features:

**Specs-Driven Development**: Kiro IDE's specification system enabled clear, structured development of the modular architecture. The JSON-based specifications for site generation and component definitions provided a single source of truth, ensuring consistency across the 2,400+ files.

**Intelligent Hooks**: Development hooks in Kiro IDE automated repetitive tasks and enforced coding standards throughout the project. These hooks helped maintain code quality across the 350K+ lines of code, catching issues early and ensuring consistent patterns in the TypeScript/JavaScript codebase.

**Guided Steering**: Kiro IDE's steering capabilities provided intelligent navigation and refactoring support, which proved invaluable during the multiple rounds of restructuring that ultimately led to the cleaner Solobase architecture. The IDE's understanding of the project structure made it possible to safely refactor large portions of the codebase while maintaining functionality.

The combination of these Kiro IDE features accelerated development, reduced errors, and enabled the confident evolution from initial prototype to the refined Solobase platform.
