# Error Handling Implementation Summary

## Task 6: Implement comprehensive error handling

This document summarizes the comprehensive error handling features implemented for the real-time profile synchronization system.

### 6.1 Popup Blocking Detection and Fallback Strategies ✅

#### Enhanced Popup Blocking Detection
- **Multiple Detection Methods**: Implemented 5 different methods to detect popup blocking:
  1. Check if popup window is immediately closed
  2. Check if popup window has no location
  3. Try to access popup properties (cross-origin safe)
  4. Check window dimensions (blocked popups often have 0 dimensions)
  5. Test focus capability and accessibility

- **Advanced Detection**: Added delayed verification with multiple checks over time to catch popup blockers that activate after initial opening

- **Fallback Strategies**: Implemented comprehensive fallback options:
  - User-friendly notifications with actionable guidance
  - Automatic new tab opening as fallback
  - Modal overlay for mobile devices and blocked scenarios
  - Browser notifications (when permission granted)

#### User Experience Enhancements
- **Custom Events**: Dispatch detailed events for UI integration:
  - `popup-blocked` event with recovery actions
  - Browser notifications with proper permissions handling
  - Guidance for users on how to enable popups

### 6.2 Communication Failure Recovery Mechanisms ✅

#### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- **Smart Retry**: Exponential backoff retry logic for failed communications
- **Multiple Attempts**: Configurable maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
- **Progressive Delays**: Base delay of 1000ms with exponential increase

#### Automatic Fallback Communication Methods
- **Primary**: BroadcastChannel API for modern browsers
- **Fallback**: localStorage events for older browsers or when BroadcastChannel fails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when all methods fail

#### Comprehensive Error Reporting
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error logs with context and debugging information
- **Failed Event Storage**: Store failed events for potential manual retry
- **Monitoring Events**: Dispatch events for external monitoring systems
- **Recovery Options**: Provide users with recovery actions when failures occur

#### Communication Failure Recovery Features
- **Failed Event Tracking**: Store up to 50 failed events with error details
- **Manual Retry**: API to retry all failed events
- **Error Context**: Capture communication method, online status, queue size, and user agent
- **Custom Events**: Dispatch `profile-sync-failure` and `profile-sync-error` events

### 6.3 Network Connectivity Handling ✅

#### Enhanced Online/Offline Detection
- **Multi-Method Detection**: Combine navigator.onLine with connection quality monitoring
- **Connection Quality**: Monitor actual connectivity with lightweight requests
- **Slow Connection Handling**: Detect and handle very slow connections (slow-2g)

#### Intelligent Queue Management
- **Offline Queuing**: Automatically queue profile changes when offline
- **Queue Limits**: Enforce maximum queue size (100 events) with oldest-first removal
- **Event Deduplication**: Replace duplicate events of same type and user

#### Network Recovery Features
- **Automatic Sync Recovery**: Comprehensive recovery when connection is restored:
  1. Process all queued events
  2. Retry previously failed events
  3. Request sync verification from server
- **Connection Monitoring**: Periodic connection quality checks (every 30 seconds)
- **Failure Threshold**: Mark as offline after 3 consecutive connection failures

#### User Notifications
- **Status Events**: Dispatch connectivity change events:
  - `profile-sync-connectivity` for status changes
  - `profile-sync-online` when connection restored
  - `profile-sync-offline` when connection lost
- **Queue Information**: Inform users about queued changes and sync status

## Testing Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Popup Detection**: Test mobile device detection and modal decision logic
- **Error Handling**: Test error logging, failed event tracking, and status reporting
- **Network Handling**: Test online status detection, queue management, and recovery
- **Fallback Strategies**: Test popup fallback options and notification systems
- **Validation**: Test enhanced event validation and data sanitization
- **Serialization**: Test event serialization with error handling and integrity checks
- **Communication**: Test subscription management and broadcasting with recovery
- **Resource Management**: Test proper cleanup and resource management

### Key Test Results
- ✅ All 8 error handling tests passing
- ✅ Popup blocking detection working correctly
- ✅ Communication failure recovery functional
- ✅ Network connectivity handling operational
- ✅ Event validation and sanitization working
- ✅ Resource cleanup preventing memory leaks

## API Enhancements

### New Public Methods
- `requestNotificationPermission()`: Request browser notification permissions
- `getFailedEvents()`: Get failed events for debugging or recovery
- `retryFailedEvents()`: Retry all failed events
- `clearFailedEvents()`: Clear failed events storage
- `getErrorLog()`: Get error log for debugging
- `clearErrorLog()`: Clear error log
- `getStatus()`: Get comprehensive status information

### Enhanced Existing Methods
- `openProfilePopup()`: Now includes advanced blocking detection and fallback strategies
- `broadcastProfileChange()`: Enhanced with automatic fallback communication methods
- `broadcastProfileChangeThrottled()`: Improved with better error handling and recovery

## Security Considerations

### Enhanced Security Features
- **Origin Validation**: Strict origin validation for postMessage communications
- **Message Validation**: Comprehensive event validation and sanitization
- **Data Sanitization**: Remove script tags and HTML from event data
- **Checksum Validation**: Integrity validation for serialized events
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in throttling to prevent abuse

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Error Handling
- **Memory Management**: Limited storage for failed events and error logs
- **Timer Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of all timers and intervals
- **Resource Management**: Comprehensive cleanup of all resources
- **Event Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate events in queues
- **Throttling**: Intelligent throttling to prevent spam

## Requirements Fulfilled
