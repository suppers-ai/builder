# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a simple showcase website for the JSON App Compiler UI Library components. The website will display all available UI components (Button, Input, Card, Layout) with interactive examples showing their different variants, props, and visual states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all available UI library components displayed on a single page, so that I can quickly browse and understand what components are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display all four UI components (Button, Input, Card, Layout) on the homepage
2. WHEN a user views the page THEN the system SHALL show each component with a clear title and description
3. WHEN a user scrolls through the page THEN the system SHALL organize components in a clean, easy-to-scan layout
4. WHEN a user loads the page THEN the system SHALL display components using the actual UI library code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see different variants and states of each component, so that I can understand the full range of options available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the Button component section THEN the system SHALL display all button variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, danger) and sizes (sm, md, lg)
2. WHEN a user views the Input component section THEN the system SHALL display different input types (text, email, password) and states (normal, error, disabled)
3. WHEN a user views the Card component section THEN the system SHALL display different card variants (default, outlined, elevated) with various content examples
4. WHEN a user views the Layout component section THEN the system SHALL display different layout variants (default, centered, sidebar, header-footer) with sample content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the props and configuration options for each component, so that I can understand how to customize them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a component section THEN the system SHALL display the main props available for that component
2. WHEN a user sees prop examples THEN the system SHALL show the prop name, type, and example values
3. WHEN a user views component examples THEN the system SHALL indicate which props are being used for each variant
4. WHEN a user needs reference information THEN the system SHALL provide a simple props table or list for each component

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see code examples for each component, so that I can copy and use them in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a component example THEN the system SHALL display the JSX code used to create that example
2. WHEN a user wants to copy code THEN the system SHALL provide a copy button for each code example
3. WHEN a user views code examples THEN the system SHALL show realistic, usable code snippets
4. WHEN a user sees multiple variants THEN the system SHALL provide code examples for the most common configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user browsing on different devices, I want the showcase website to work well on mobile and desktop, so that I can view components regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the website on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout that works on small screens
2. WHEN a user navigates on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure component examples are clearly visible and interactive
3. WHEN a user views the site on desktop THEN the system SHALL make efficient use of screen space to show multiple examples
4. WHEN a user interacts with components THEN the system SHALL ensure buttons and inputs work properly on touch devices
